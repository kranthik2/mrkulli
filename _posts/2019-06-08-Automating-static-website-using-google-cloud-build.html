<h5>Create build trigger</h5>
<p>Go to Goggle Cloud Build → Build Triggers section on the GCP Console and click “Add trigger”:</p>

<p>Select GitHub as the source of your repository. In the next screen, you may be asked to authorize access to your GitHub account and repositories. This is needed for Google Cloud Source Repositories to mirror and create commit hooks on your GitHub repositories.</p>

<p>Then, pick your repository from the list</p>

<p>In the next screen</p>
<ol>
<li>give this Build Trigger a name (e.g. master)</li>
<li>choose Build Configuration "cloudbuild.yaml"</li>
<li>choose Trigger Type ”Branch”</li>
<li>Set the file location to cloudbuild.yaml</li>
</ol>

<p>create a cloudbuild.yaml file with the following contents in your repository.</p>
<p>I am using jekyll for static site builder, _site 	
directory is where the generated site will be placed (by default) once Jekyll is done build. replace <strong>_site</strong> with your website content directory</p>

{% highlight yml %}
steps:
  - name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/gsutil
    args: ["-m", "rsync", "-r", "-c", "-d", "_site/", "gs://{BUCKET_NAME}"]
{% endhighlight %}

<p>YAML file declares a build step with the gsutil -m rsync command and makes sure that the website is uploaded to the storage bucket. The -m flag accelerates upload by processing multiple files in parallel and the -c flag avoids re-uploading unchanged files.</p>

<h5>Trigger the first build</h5>
<p>
Once you push the cloudbuild.yaml file to your repository and create the Build Trigger, you can kick off the first build manually. Head over to the GCP Console Build Triggers section, click <strong>“Run Trigger”</strong> </p>
