<p>Iptables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IP packet filter rules in the Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined. Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.</p>

<p>
Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches. This is called a 'target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table.</p>

<p>
A firewall rule specifies criteria for a packet, and a target. If the packet does not match, the next rule in the chain is the examined; if it does match, then the next rule is specified by the value of the target, which can be the name of a user-defined chain or one of the special values ACCEPT, DROP, QUEUE, or RETURN. ACCEPT means to let the packet through. DROP means to drop the packet on the floor. QUEUE means to pass the packet to userspace.
</p>

<p>
On Linux, Docker manipulates iptables rules to provide network isolation. All of Docker’s iptables rules are added to the DOCKER chain. Do not manipulate this table manually. If you need to add rules which load before Docker’s rules, add them to the DOCKER-USER chain. These rules are loaded before any rules Docker creates automatically.
</p>

<strong>Restrict connections to the Docker container</strong>

<p>
By default, all external source IPs are allowed to connect to the Docker. To allow only a specific IP or network to access the containers, insert a negated rule at the top of the DOCKER filter chain. For example, the following rule restricts external access to all IP addresses except  172.217.0.142:
</p>

{% highlight shell %}

$ iptables -I DOCKER-USER -i ext_if ! -s 172.217.0.142 -j DROP
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
You could instead allow connections from a source subnet. The following rule only allows access from the subnet  172.217.0.142/24:</p>

{% highlight shell %}
$ iptables -I DOCKER-USER -i ext_if ! -s  172.217.0.142/24 -j DROP
{% endhighlight  %}
<p>
 you can specify a range of IP addresses to accept using --src-range or -s : </p>

{% highlight shell %}
$ iptables -I DOCKER-USER -m iprange -i ext_if ! -s 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.3 -j DROP
{% endhighlight %}
